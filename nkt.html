                    Neurokinetic therapy (NKT) forms the foundation of The Recovery Labs philosophy and we are Merseyside’s only registered NKT practitioner. 
                    NKT is an innovative therapeutic method that can help you to unlearn dysfunctional movement patterns caused by injury, poor posture or dysfunctional movement patterns.

                NKT uses a system of muscle tests to identify where in a movement pattern the cause of dysfunction is located. 
                It can reveal faulty muscle and movement ‘memories’ in the brain’s motor control centre (MCC), the area of the brain which coordinates all the bodies movements. 
                More often than not when other treatments have failed and your pain is “mysterious,” NKT is the answer.
            </p>  <br>
            <p>
                NKT is used as both an assessment and rehabilitation technique for:

            <ul>
                <li>lower back pain</li>
                <li>neck pain</li>
                <li>hip pain</li>
                <li>knee pain</li>
                <li>carpal tunnel syndrome</li>
                <li>running injuries</li>
                <li>old scars</li>
                <li>joint dysfunction</li>
                <li>tight muscles</li>
                <li>anyone who exerts a lot of energy regularly (whether you’re a professional athlete, a yogi, or a dancer)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>
                What will happen during your NKT session?
            </h4> <br>
            <p>
                Let’s take an example of lower back pain NKT assessment: We will ask you to breathe out and meet the resistance as we gently push on your leg. 
                For the first half second, your body remembers how to meet this light pressure. 
                It may seem strange at first but we only ask your body to respond in ways it knows how. 
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                As you lay there with your heels pressing down on the table, we check just one of your core muscles, yet you may feel all the muscles in your neck begin to fire. 
                This indicates that your neck muscles are overworking because your core isn’t working as it should. 
                This may be due to hunching at your desk, jutting your chin, and using your accessory neck muscles to breathe instead of your diaphragm. 
                By identifying these dysfunctional movement patterns and retraining them we can and get your body moving in an optimal manner.
            </p> <br>
            <h4>
                How does it work?
            </h4> <br>
            <p>
                Neurokinetic Therapy is based on the following premise: when an injury occurs, certain muscles shut down or weaken, forcing other muscles to overcompensate, causing dysfunction & pain. When a muscle is weak, the MCC causes us to adopt new movement patterns. Unfortunately this adaptation to trauma can cause problems in the long run. Think about this: after an injury, your MCC chooses the path of least resistance (your most successful repeat attempts at optimal movement). The most effective learning by repetition happens when you fail; 
                much like a baby learning how to walk but falling over repeatedly, so the MCC learns your compensation patterns and holds them in memory—unless it can be convinced to change.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                The great news is old dogs can learn new tricks. This “failure” is the perfect opportunity for the NKT protocol to help reprogram your movements. 
                Correcting these dysfunctional patterns is vital to successful healing.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                We test your body’s reaction to various movements, stances, and pressure. We review your present and past injuries and examine your movement patterns to discover the weak points affecting your balance to reveal the fundamental causes of your pain. Expect a personalised set of exercises. 
                Because stretching and massaging is often emphasized, while essential strength and stability is frequently neglected, we make sure to incorporate practical functional movements into you treatment program - a deadlift can work wonders folks!
