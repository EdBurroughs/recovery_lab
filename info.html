            <h2>Do You Need Treatment?</h2>

                <p>
                    Our clients often worry that if aches, pains & injuries are left untreated they could worsen. 
                    Equally people hope that their physical issues will improve by themselves overtime. Therefore deciding whether a course of therapy is necessary can be difficult. <br>
                    Below are a few points that you might find helpful as a guide.

                    Is your pain is mechanical?
                </h4> <br>
                <p>
                    By ‘mechanical’ we mean a problem that is worsened by physical stresses. For example, knee pain made worse by using stairs, or hip pain exacerbated by swimming. If there is a mechanical competent to your pain, physiotherapy or Neurokinetic Therapy may be the correct treatment for you.

                    Seeking Physiotherapy if the pain is not getting better, or getting worse.
                </h4> <br>
                <p>
                    We’re often asked, “Should I have come to see you earlier?”. This is difficult to judge as people often get pains that will eventually improve without treatment. Therefore, clients will ignore the pain for a while hoping that it will resolve naturally. Pains that are not getting better, or even worsening, may require professional intervention, or at least an assessment to understand how long it is likely to take to improve, and to recommend things that you can do to facilitate the recovery process. 
                    Some conditions like Tendonitis/Tendinopathy may settle with rest but flare up each time you try to engage in physical activity. If so, then strengthening and rehabilitation may be required and Physiotherapy could be extremely helpful.

                    If the pain is affecting your movement or ability to carry out daily activities
                </h4> <br>
                <p>
                    GP’s can often be difficult to see and are limited by the time and resources they can offer. 
                    If you have severe neck pain or experience the sudden onset of lower back pain, causing you difficulty in functioning, it may be best to see a physiotherapist who will quickly diagnose and treat your symptoms. 
                    A physiotherapist will also screen you for any underlying issues that would require you to attend A&E for further investigation.

                    Chronic Pain that interferes with daily activities, hobbies or sports.
                </h4> <br>
                <p>
                    Pains can gradually prevent us from doing activities; we will slowly give up our interests because of restricted movement, weakness or pain. We encounter people who are unable to return to sport after an injury because they have a perception that they are too weak or they risk re-injuring themselves. Physiotherapy & Neurokinetic Therapy can be extremely effective in these circumstances.
                    We will investigate whether there is any muscle weakness, tightness or reduced proprioception - the body’s ability to perceive its own position. Or any balance or coordination issues resulting in instability when performing an activity, addressing these deficits and helping you get back to your usual level of activity.
